The Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) ecosystem for digital hardware design, to work with devices such as FPGAs and ASICs, is growing and can be difficult to know the alternatives and be up-to-date.
Our aim is to provide a gentle introduction to the main development tools, in a common place.
With this on mind, each tool is categorized and has an overview, useful links and a few simple examples, capable of be used as starting point, or to decide which option tailors your needs.
